# List runtime dependencies here.
# Do not pin specific versions of dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
# Instead, set bounds on major version ranges of dependencies in accordance with SemVer (https://semver.org).
# If you must pin a specific version of a dependency, note the reason to do so in a comment line
# immediately preceding the dependency.

# Only dependencies which are directly imported by this library should be listed here. Dependencies
# should manage their sub-dependencies. (If a sub-dependency must be restricted to a specific version
# range, and upstream won't do so, note this in a comment.)
